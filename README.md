# ColorQuestForPreSchool
ColorQuest is a simple color learning game for preschoolers, created in C++ with OpenGL. Kids identify the color of objects by clicking the matching color button. This project was developed as a Computer Graphics assignment and is still under development. It demonstrates 2D rendering, mouse input, and basic game logic.
